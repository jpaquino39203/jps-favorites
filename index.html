            <p>These is a website I made to discuss some of my favorite things. I currently have the pages for my
                favorite short stories, books, and movies set up, with plans to make pages for my favorite songs,
                albums, and dishes. </p>

            <p>As a heads-up, I do go into <strong><i>minor spoilers</i></strong> for every piece I discuss, which 
                are listed in no particular order or ranking. If you have any recommendations for me (book, movie,
                song, dish, anything!), feel free to check out the "Submit a Recommendation" page.

            <p>I hope you enjoy my ramblings!</p>
