                "The Proxy Marriage" is my go-to feel-good story. Having read both of Maile Meloy’s short story collections—<i>Half 
                in Love</i> and <i>Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It</i>—I’ve found that her stories consistently leave me with a quiet
                sense of awe. Her prose is concise and accessible, yet it carries real emotional
                weight. It <i>feels</i> effortless, but there's real craft behind it: she's able to articulate a wide
                range of emotions with carefully placed details or metaphors that give her stories so much color. In
                "The Proxy Marriage," she balances loaded themes like 9/11 and the consequences of the Iraq
                war with more relatable ones like unrequited love, chasing a dream, growing up. The narrative feels lived
                in
                and spans years without ever dragging or rushing through key moments, and concludes with a (mostly)
                happy ending that feels earned and leaves you with a warm, fuzzy feeling that lasts throughout the
                day.

                "Neighbors" is probably the most fun I’ve ever had reading a short story. There's just something about
                the way Zach Williams turns a simple reconciliation-after-an-affair plot into something both
                inexplicable and
                exhilarating. "Neighbors" is a story that thrives on its own
                tension and leans into its growing sense of strangeness to drive the momentum; in it, we follow a
                narrator who struggles to make sense of an increasingly unfamiliar situation (My favorite line in the
                whole story: "He had to go. This time, I thought, he would, of course, go down. When he didn't, I saw
                how very small my understanding of or purchase over all of this was."). Right when you think he's
                about to have an epiphany of some kind, the moment slips away from him, seemingly forever. Then the
                story ends, and you’re left just as bewildered as the protagonist, yet the story feels
                whole (and lingers in your mind for days).

                “When Stars Collide” is the shortest entry on this list–1550 words!–but that isn’t why it’s one of my
                favorite stories to revisit. This was my first real introduction to Ottessa Moshfegh, now one of my
                favorite writers. What really drew me into this story–a witty reimagining of the how-I-met-my-partner
                narrative–was Moshfegh's sense of irony. The plot centers on a struggling actor who is
                intentionally difficult to sympathize with, yet Moshfegh portrays him as both engaging and, at times,
                unexpectedly relatable. This, paired with Moshfegh's stark, economical sense of setting,
                make for a memorable character sketch that is darkly humorous and a touch melancholic. The last
                line–"That was Elizabeth: she was my emptiness."–is an especially memorable one, mostly because of the
                confused, sickly feeling it left me with the first time I read it.

                I first encountered Ted Chiang’s “Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom” during my third year of
                undergrad, as part of an assigned reading for a class on science fiction. The story is set in a world
                much like ours, the most notable difference being that its people have developed the technology to
                communicate across parallel universes. Chiang uses that technology–incorporating concepts from the
                Many-Worlds Interpretation–to shine light on his characters, many of whom wrestle with guilt from past
                choices and the desire to make better ones. The narrative behind “Anxiety” is a human one, summed up
                perfectly by my favorite in-story quote: “‘None of us are saints, but we can all try to be better. Each
                time you do something generous, you’re shaping yourself into someone who’s more likely to be generous
                next time, and that matters.’” Though it remains grounded and pragmatic in its approach to
                redemption, it is also, at its core, a painfully hopeful narrative.

                I've deliberately avoided the topic of criticisms in these lists because these are my favorites after
                all, and I would much rather discuss the reasons why I like them so much–that said, I can’t think of a
                single thing that I would change about “So Late in the Day.” This story is incredible. Claire Keegan
                demonstrates masterful command over every aspect of her narrative. Her prose is precise, economical, cutting.
                She deftly fosters a sense of dread through carefully placed details (a
                loss of appetite, a comment on the unnecessarily large number of pillows sitting on the couch) and
                disciplined pacing, taking her time in setting up the “pieces.” That feeling of dread doesn’t let up
                until the very last sentence–by which point you’re left reeling. It’s such an uncomfortable story to
                read, unflinching in its themes and delivery, but it also warrants–and rewards–multiple
                rereads. A powerhouse of a
                short story.
