                Despite being one of my favorite movies, <i>The Farewell</i> is not something I rewatch often. Certainly
                it’s an
                amazing film, well-made and thought-provoking, with layered, sympathetic characters played
                by great, level-headed actors. It’s also terribly dispiriting. Director Lulu Wang’s offbeat brand of
                filmmaking adds layers of humor and humanity to an otherwise quietly morbid family drama. The film delves into
                the clash between Eastern and Western cultural norms, specifically regarding the concept of truth and
                how it is communicated in the context of a terminal illness. This movie is by no means an easy watch and will
                likely leave you with more questions than answers–which, in my view, adds to its strength. Any film that
                leaves its audience stunned and contemplative is doing something right.</p>

                <i>Your Name.</i> (Japanese: <i>君の名は。</i>) is a <i>wonderful</i> time from start to finish. As the only
                animated entry on this list, visually speaking, this movie is gorgeous. Every backdrop is beautifully
                drawn and meticulously detailed. Characters’ movements are expressive and fluid. The “camera work” is
                dynamic. Add in a soaring musical score, solid voice performances, and an engrossing fantasy plot
                with a shocking and well-executed twist–and you have a timeless animated classic (as well as my go-to
                comfort movie).

                <i>Return of the Jedi</i> has one undeniable advantage over the other movies on this list: nostalgia.
                Growing up, I watched this movie on DVD all the time. It was–and still is–my favorite of the <i>Star
                    Wars</i>
                films, for its amazing space battle finale, its iconic dialogue and performances, its themes of
                rebellion and resisting
                despair. In addition to being enchantingly entertaining, this is a movie that informed my values during my
                childhood, and
                every rewatch only confirms that those values still resonate just as deeply today.
                The <i>Star Wars</i> saga is one of hope and
                redemption, something <i>Return of the Jedi</i> embodies perfectly.</p>

                What sets <i>Spider-Man 2</i> apart from a lot of other comic book movies is the amount of
                characterization
                given to its protagonist, Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Peter, like many of us, struggles to find balance in
                his life; his grades are falling, he’s always showing up late for work, he’s behind on his rent. The
                people in his life think him unreliable–all because of his crime-fighting responsibilities.
                Simultaneously, the villain Otto Octavius–brought to life by the mesmerizing Alfred Molina–battles
                compelling demons of his own. These personal conflicts are the driving force of this movie, and they
                give every action sequence–including the iconic “train fight” sequence–so much more meaning. Of
                course,
                none of these elements would be nearly as effective without director Sam Raimi’s unique style (a
                whole
                lot of whip pans), which renders the movie a near-perfect blend of drama, humor, and action.</p>

                The term “quietly devastating” comes to mind when I think of <i>Aftersun</i>, which centers on Calum and
                Sophie, a father and daughter vacationing together at a beach resort; decades later, an adult Sophie
                reflects on this time spent with her father in an effort to understand him. This is a
                semi-autobiographical
                film from writer and director Charlotte Wells, who does an excellent job of blending different
                narratives–young Sophie, adult Sophie, and Calum–each with their own themes and sensitivities. Leads
                Paul Mescal and Frankie Corio–who play Calum and young Sophie, respectively–play their parts so
                <i>naturally</i>. Their rapport feels authentic, capturing both the awkward and tender parts of a
                parent-child relationship. The cinematography, which makes considerable use of long takes and
                dialogue
                pauses, only enhances the film’s nuanced and realistic tone. It’s a deeply personal film, effective
                in
                its emotional delivery but also distinct in its voice.
